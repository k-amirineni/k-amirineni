## 💡 What Drives Me

- ![Knowledge](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/20/000000/classroom.png) **Knowledge Sharing:**  
  I thrive in environments where learning is constant and enjoy uplifting those around me. Whether introducing coding best practices, conducting design walk-throughs, or mentoring engineers and business analysts, I find fulfillment in enabling others' growth.

- ![Architecture](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/20/000000/flow-chart.png) **Architectural Rigor:**  
  I'm deeply curious about how systems work—and how they fail. Crafting robust distributed architectures, leading refactoring initiatives, or optimizing for performance, I take pride in building reliable foundations.

- ![Innovation](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/20/000000/idea.png) **Innovation and Experimentation:**  
  Hackathons and proofs of concept energize me. I've built AI-powered agents, explored natural language automation, and applied predictive analytics—always seeking ways to integrate technology that solves real business problems.

- ![Team](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/20/000000/conference-call.png) **Team Enablement:**  
  I value a culture of documentation, thorough code reviews, and open feedback. Seeing new hires onboard quickly or supporting teams through continuous improvement is what keeps me motivated.
